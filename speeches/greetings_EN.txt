Greetings to everyone, and thank you very much for being there for this wonderful day, Betty’s and Romain’s wedding.
Before the celebration begins, I’d like to give you few instructions.
A professional photographer is here. The newlyweds would like to have pictures of you and the ceremony without visible phones. The picture will be even more marvelous. So please, don’t take pictures with your phone, and put them in airplane or silent mode.
For those who are not fluent in English, you can have access to the transcripts in French or Chinese through the given QR-codes inside the leaflet you have been given when you arrived at the castle. And at any point during the event, if you hear this bell sound, it means that a speech is about to start and you should open the transcript if you need to.
We are all gathered today to celebrate the union of Betty and Romain, in this amazing place, and your presence will make this a wonderful day for the future bride and groom. Marriage is a supreme sharing of experience and an adventure in the most intimate human relationship. It is the union of two people whose complicity and mutual understanding have blossomed around the same values and project. Today, Betty and Romain proclaim to the world their commitment, their shared desire for love and plans for the future.
During this ceremony, some of their closest friends and relatives will have a word, as witnesses of the mutual love. 
After the grrom and the bride read their vows to each other, and exchange rings, they will seal their love and commitment by lighting the Unity Candle together. Their light, just as their life, will then “become one”.
To begin, we now need the stars of the day, beginning with Romain, the parents and the witnesses. Give them a warm welcome.
And now, I would like to ask you to rise for the bride.
