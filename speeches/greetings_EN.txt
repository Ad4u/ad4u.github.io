Greetings to everyone, and thank you very much for being there for this wonderful day, Betty’s and Romain’s wedding.
Before the celebration begins, I’d like to give you few instructions.
A professional photographer is here. The newlyweds would like to have pictures of you and the ceremony without visible phones. The picture will be even more marvelous. So please, don’t take pictures with your phone, and put them in airplane or silent mode.
For those who are not fluent in English, you can have access to the transcripts in French or Chinese through the given QR-codes.
We are all gathered today to celebrate the union of Betty and Romain, in this amazing place, and your presence will make this a wonderful day for the future bride and groom. Marriage is a supreme sharing of experience and an adventure in the most intimate human relationship. It is the union of two people whose complicity and mutual understanding have blossomed around the same values and project. Today, Betty and Romain proclaim to the world their commitment, their shared desire for projects and their love.
During this ceremony, some of their closest friends and relatives will have a word, as witnesses of the mutual love. 
After the vows, and the exchange of the rings, the newlyweds will seal their love and commitment by lightning a large candle together, from their own smaller candle. Their lights, as their life, will then “become one”.
To begin, we now need the stars of the day: Betty & Romain, with their parents. Please stand up and give them a warm welcome.
