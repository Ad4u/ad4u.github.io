Mesdames et messieurs, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Jason Lo. I am Betty's father. And this is Sandy, her motherToday, we gather here to celebrate Betty and Romain's wedding. I stanbefore you and my heart is filled with joy and pride. As I see theembark on a journey toward happiness.
Betty is my precious. From the first moment she was with us, our familwas filled with laughter, warmth, happiness, and love. She had alwaybeen a sweet girl. I'll tell you a story**.** One day, when she walittle, I took her to a convenience store. I bought her a soft drink fo10 Taiwanese dollars. I took out a one-hundred-dollar bill and gave ito the clerk. He gave me back 90 dollars in coins. Betty grabbed thcoins from my hand and dropped them all into the charity box. She was slittle she didn't even know how much 90 dollars was. I never taught heto do that. She did it by her nature. And I was so proud of her.
Later she grew up to be a big girl---kind, loving, compassionategenerous, and pretty as always. I looked at her and I wondered who thluckiest man in the world would be to marry her. Well, the answer ihere. Romain, I am sure you know how lucky you are to marry Betty. AnBetty, I know you feel the same way too, to marry the best husband ithe world. I congratulate you both.
Romain, you've not only won my daughter's heart but the hearts of ouentire family. We like you, not because you are tall, but because yoare one kind, gentle, wise and considerate big boy. I am joyful as whave not only gained a son-in-law but also a dear friend. For the passome 25 years, I have done my utmost to treasure and protect Betty. Antoday, I hand her over to you. I trust you will love her and cherish heas much as I do. Welcome to our family.
As to advice, I have no advice for you. My parents didn't give me anadvice. You will learn to support and cherish each other all byourselves. The only thing I can tell you is that marriage is like roller coaster ride. It goes up and down. But it is fun. So, enjoy! Andon't fall off.
I want to take a moment to express our deepest appreciation to Dominiquand Alain, who have warmly welcomed us into their lives. I sincerelhope that in the near future we could manage a trip when we all gtogether, with the kids, maybe grandkids too. That would be the moswonderful thing to do.
And now, I ask you all to raise your glasses, let us toast to the happcouple, wishing them a happy and eternal marriage.
Cheers !
