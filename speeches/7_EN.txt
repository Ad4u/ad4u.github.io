Romain, we met at judo, when we were only 7 or 8 years old, or a feyears later in middle school. Time has flown by.
It must have often felt like "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, faaway" to you. And yet, here we are at your wedding, just a fekilometers from where we started, and only a few years after those firsmoments we spent together.
But enough with the clich√©s. Today, Romain, you've married Betty. Anit's Betty that we intend to share some childhood memories of the mashe has married. Because there must be some traces left of thanot-so-distant Romain.
We propose a somewhat playful format: 4 truths, 1 lie; and probably somadvice along the waySince adolescence, Romain has been using his drawing talents to captivate his friends' imaginationThe power of imagination... We used to play role-playing gamewhen we were kids. Thomas was the master gamekeeper, but Romain was definitely the one who could help visualize the charactersHe already had remarkable graphic talent: I lost the portrai        Romain had made of my mad scientist on Tatooine, and it's a bi        regret for me.
Some memorable evenings were hosted at Romain's parents' house. H    wasn't necessarily the most sober; a crate of his little brother'    Lego paid the price.
The anecdote is true... but it wasn't Romain who was on th        wrong side of the blocks. It was indeed one of our childhoo        friends, but not your dear master of ceremonies, nor any of you        humble servants. Anyway, I promised some advice. If you have         child, remember to wash the Legos! And let them have the hous        to themselves occasionally: it may entail some risks, it's no        necessarily the best for their health, but it makes for fu        memories... and it doesn't prevent them from becomin        well-balanced adults.
Romain likes sports that aren't really sports.
Romain practiced a activity called baseball for a fe        years. If you ever settle down somewhere and there's space        expect to be throwing a ball around with Romain.
Romain almost had a crush on my mother.
That's obviously false, but it contains a truth my mothe        sometimes brings up. It proves that Romain knows how to leave a        impression, and also knows how to be charming. You'v        experienced it, Betty.
It's time to put away the grandparents... Because while we're o    the subject of the elderly - Mom, if you're listening... - Romai    definitely knows how to handle the elderly; this time targetin    Thomas's grandparents.
There was a time when Romain and Thomas were looking for work        Gently. By going for a walk to Mont Saint Michel, probably t        benefit from the well-known help of cold water in getting you        thoughts straight. It turns out it was also the city o        Thomas's grandparents. And the time wasn't very good for th        family. After explaining the situation to Romain, he greeted i        with words full of wisdom that resonate today on this weddin        day: "you know, they've had a good life, and despite all that        look at the bond they share today!".
Romain is undoubtedly someone who has his share of complexity, but whaemerges from the memories we've shared here is actually someone simplekind-hearted, and delightfully quirky. Lucky you, Betty.
