Good evening, bonjour, everyone!
Thank you, Romain and Betty, for inviting me to this beautiful setting in France for your wedding. Believe it or not, this is my very first time attending a French wedding, and the experience has been absolutely incredible. Honestly, I was so unsure about the local customs that I even brought a red envelope, just in case! You know, “When in doubt, give cash!” And let me tell you, choosing an outfit kept my wife up at night more than any thriller movie could.
Now, let’s talk about Betty, our superstar People Head at Slasify. Having worked with Betty for years, I can confidently say she handles pressure better than a deep-sea submarine! No matter the chaos at work, she manages to smile it off—it’s like she has a superpower that turns stress into confetti.
And then there’s Romain, what a guy! Our first meeting wasn’t in a typical setting but crammed into a karaoke room during the World Cup in Taiwan. While our friends belted out tunes, we were glued to a tiny iPad cheering on France. A big round of applause to the French team, though! I could go on about football all night, but I better cut to the chase before this turns into a sports commentary. Romain has been nothing but wonderful, patiently enduring my very basic English all evening—it’s clear he’s a keeper.
As someone who's been happily married for over ten years, here’s a little piece of advice: always play nice and respect each other. It’s not just the secret sauce to a happy marriage; it’s like a daily dose of magic.
So, here’s to Betty and Romain—may your lives together be filled with as much laughter, love, and joy as possible, and hopefully, less stress than a day at our office! Let’s raise our glasses to a long, happy, and truly fabulous life together. Cheers to the lovely bride and groom!
