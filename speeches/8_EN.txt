I recall the occasion when my wife and I were introduced to Betty back in November 2019, in Taipei.

Romain was positively brimming with excitement, much like an adolescent, and took great pride in introducing us to Betty, whom he had met a few months prior.

We had a delightful evening with our local guide, filled with fond memories, and it was evident that they were a well-suited pair.

Yet, as we bid farewell to Taiwan, we couldn't help but wonder how a long-distance relationship between two individuals who barely knew each other would endure.

However, Romain has always had a knack for consistently surprising people, and the greater the challenge, the more committed he becomes.

The story of Betty and Romain is truly inspiring, proving this at every turn. They navigated through the trials of a long-distance relationship, uncertainties about the future, separation during the Covid pandemic, challenges in securing employment in Korea, visa complications, but today, they stand together, able to wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to their lifelong love.

When I first met Romain in 2012, he was quite a different character than he is now. Sporting a Kpop-inspired haircut (hairstyles have certainly evolved over the years!), and a fashion sense that was up for debate. He was often found working overtime and weekends, following the Korean tradition, alongside some rather eccentric colleagues (let's hope they're not present tonight!).

I recall the endless conversations and debates with Benoit about the meanings of Korean words or expressions, although these occur far less frequently now, as Romain has mastered the language of his adopted country over the years.

I later discovered that he kept several notebooks filled with his precious language learnings, not only Korean but also Russian and probably Mandarin now!

Romain's personality encompasses many facets: he's a social magnet, a true entertainer, adept at dad jokes, but also someone who can withdraw for months to immerse himself in completing a car design project, producing a musical album, or conquering an old-school video game with every side quest completed.

His musical tastes are as varied as the backgrounds of his friends, ranging from metal and rap to Jpop, with friends ranging from local old restaurant owners to Seoul influencers and celebrities.

I'm certain Betty will have a blast and never grow bored with a husband who probably feels like several people rolled into one.

To Betty and Romain, I extend my sincerest wishes for a joyous and enduring marriage, and I hope you both treasure this unforgettable day.
