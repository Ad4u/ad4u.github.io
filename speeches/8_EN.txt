I recall the occasion when my wife and I were introduced to Betty bacin November 2019, in Taipei.
Romain was positively brimming with excitement, much like an adolescentand took great pride in introducing us to Betty, whom he had met a femonths prior.
We had a delightful evening with our local guide, filled with fonmemories, and it was evident that they were a well-suited pair.
Yet, as we bid farewell to Taiwan, we couldn't help but wonder how long-distance relationship between two individuals who barely knew eacother would endure.
However, Romain has always had a knack for consistently surprisinpeople, and the greater the challenge, the more committed he becomes.
The story of Betty and Romain is truly inspiring, proving this at everturn. They navigated through the trials of a long-distance relationshipuncertainties about the future, separation during the Covid pandemicchallenges in securing employment in Korea, visa complications, butoday, they stand together, able to wholeheartedly dedicate themselveto their lifelong love.
When I first met Romain in 2012, he was quite a different character thahe is now. Sporting a Kpop-inspired haircut (hairstyles have certainlevolved over the years!), and a fashion sense that was up for debate. Hwas often found working overtime and weekends, following the Koreatradition, alongside some rather eccentric colleagues (let's hopthey're not present tonight!).
I recall the endless conversations and debates with Benoit about thmeanings of Korean words or expressions, although these occur far lesfrequently now, as Romain has mastered the language of his adoptecountry over the years.
I later discovered that he kept several notebooks filled with hiprecious language learnings, not only Korean but also Russian anprobably Mandarin now.
Romain's personality encompasses many facets: he's a social magnet, true entertainer, adept at dad jokes, but also someone who can withdrafor months to immerse himself in completing a car design projectproducing a musical album, or conquering an old-school video game witevery side quest completed.
His musical tastes are as varied as the backgrounds of his friendsranging from metal and rap to Jpop, with friends ranging from local olrestaurant owners to Seoul influencers and celebrities.
I'm certain Betty will have a blast and never grow bored with a husbanwho probably feels like several people rolled into one.
To Betty and Romain, I extend my sincerest wishes for a joyous anenduring marriage, and I hope you both treasure this unforgettable day.
