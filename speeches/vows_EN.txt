We will now begin the heart of the ceremony, the very reason why we are all gathered today. The vows will be declared, the rings exchanged, and a symbolic ritual will be performed, in front of the assembly of friends and family. I now invite the groom and the bride to stand up.

You've proclaimed your desire to take your vows in front of your family and friends. Now it's time for you to have your say. Romain, the floor is yours.
