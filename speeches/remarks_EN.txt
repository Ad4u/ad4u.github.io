Before everyone exit, I’d like to disclose what’s next.

The traditional bouquet throw will take place right now. I invite all the single ladies to try their best catching these magical flowers.

The cocktails will be served right after in the garden, until 20:30. At the same time, the photographer will take group pictures, so you can have your picture shot before queuing up for the alcohol.

From 20:30, all the guests are requested to enter the tent for the dinner. Please be on time.

Finally, the dancing theatre will open at 11pm.

On behalf of the newlyweds, I thank you again for being here. Enjoy the night!
