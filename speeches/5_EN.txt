Good evening, everyone,
Firstly, thank you all for coming, sometimes from afar, to be with Betty and Romain on this important day for them.
How to sum up 36 years of life with our Romain in 4 minutes? You might say, "Start from the beginning."
Approaching thirty and anticipating parenthood, we had read and understood everything about babies. The pregnancy went smoothly, for me, Dominique was incredibly serene. She had decided to give birth in Toulouse. I missed the delivery, my mistake. So, I learned of Romain's arrival on a train platform in the early morning.
The first time I saw this little man, all my certainties were shattered. Nothing and no one can prepare you for that. After figuring out what we wanted to do, we learned to adapt to the baby who would dictate the rules for weeks, nights, months, and then years. Humility was a great lesson, as was the feeling of time slipping through our fingers. He was quickly joined by his brother; our hearts didn't balance; they simply expanded to encompass them both.
We quickly resumed traveling: Creta, Corsica, the Club Med years, the Pierre et Vacances years, the first slopes in Avoriaz. Parents were quickly overtaken as the little ones grew up. And time continued to fly by. We went to Cuba, Florida, Canada. And then our tours of European capitals on November 11th: Barcelona, Amsterdam, London, Berlin, Brussels.
And then there was drawing. Romain, in high school, wanted to do comics. "Get your degree first," retorted the conservative parents. Senior year: it was time to decide. It would be Strate College, but it was far. We found an apartment in Meudon, which would be his home for five years, one of which was spent in Detroit. He would later tell us that he felt like a little bird thrown out of the nest by unworthy parents. We accepted it; we watched our Romain grow from afar, mature, and fend for himself. The we went to Korea; Skype was my friend.
Wonderful moments: a four-week road trip through Australia with the four of us, two weeks hopping from island to island in Fiji. Romain sketching in his inseparable sketchbook. And then more difficult moments: a bike fall while we were in Seoul. What to do? It was August, and Olivier, his former drawing teacher, was our savior. Not easy from a distance.
Simple, priceless moments, like sharing a pizza in our favorite restaurant in Meudon. A weekend in Tokyo, where I heard our Romain babbling in Japanese with a laughing taxi driver. Climbing Halla san together, the volcano on Jeju Island, or riding horses in the Mongolian steppes. Some small miracles: a mission in France to attend and celebrate his Strate diploma. Job hunting, eventually returning to Korea and staying there just as we left for Russia. He would have to fend for himself again. The SAQ and then LG years, and time seemed to fly by faster and faster. With Jérémie now in Switzerland, bringing all four of us together became a challenge. A Christmas in Moscow, then our sixtieth birthday celebration. Miraculously, I was in Seoul for his thirtieth birthday, which we could celebrate together. Covid didn't make things easier; thank you, Zoom. A shadow behind the webcam, we met Betty.
We met her in person at Christmas just over two years ago. We were in Geneva, and the kids were together, a rare happiness that we savored without moderation. Betty was adorable, always smiling, cheerful, a real joy.
We were fortunate to have them with us again in La Rochelle last year, this time with the opportunity to get to know Betty, to enjoy her curiosity, her smile. A ray of sunshine in the house. She won over uncles, brothers, and future cousins, in Paris, Bourges, Toulouse, Bordeaux, or in Touraine, her tour de France of families and friends. We never got tired of it; she is just too far away.
Thanks to Sandy and Jason for welcoming Romain into their family. We will have had too little time to get to know each other. I sincerely hope that the near future will give us the opportunity to reunite somewhere on this planet.
We don't have children for ourselves, easy to say. Ultimately, if we're honest, it's our children who made us grow up. We were never perfect, but Dom and I are very proud of what you've become, and we are very happy to welcome Betty into our family and see you both so well together, carving your path, full of projects. As Dom has already said, please: Enjoy the journey!
And I propose a toast to wish all the possible happiness to our two lovebirds.
