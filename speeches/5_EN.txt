Good evening, everyone.
Firstly, thank you all for coming, sometimes from afar, to be with Bettand Romain on this important day for them.
How to sum up 36 years of life with our Romain in 4 minutes? You mighsay, "Start from the beginning".
Approaching thirty and anticipating parenthood, we had read anunderstood everything about babies. The pregnancy went smoothly, for meDominique was incredibly serene. She had decided to give birth iToulouse. I missed the delivery, my mistake. So, I learned of Romain'arrival on a train platform in the early morning.
The first time I saw this little man, all my certainties were shatteredNothing and no one can prepare you for that. After figuring out what wwanted to do, we learned to adapt to the baby who would dictate thrules for weeks, nights, months, and then years. Humility was a grealesson, as was the feeling of time slipping through our fingers. He waquickly joined by his brother; our hearts didn't balance; they simplexpanded to encompass them both.
We quickly resumed traveling: Creta, Corsica, the Club Med years, thPierre et Vacances years, the first slopes in Avoriaz. Parents werquickly overtaken as the little ones grew up. And time continued to flby. We went to Cuba, Florida, Canada. And then our tours of Europeacapitals on November 11th: Barcelona, Amsterdam, London, BerlinBrussels.
And then there was drawing. Romain, in high school, wanted to do comics"Get your degree first" retorted the conservative parents. Senioyear: it was time to decide. It would be Strate College, but it was farWe found an apartment in Meudon, which would be his home for five yearsone of which was spent in Detroit. He would later tell us that he fellike a little bird thrown out of the nest by unworthy parents. Waccepted it; we watched our Romain grow from afar, mature, and fend fohimself. The we went to Korea; Skype was my friend.
Wonderful moments: a four-week road trip through Australia with the fouof us, two weeks hopping from island to island in Fiji. Romain sketchinin his inseparable sketchbook. And then more difficult moments: a bikfall while we were in Seoul. What to do? It was August, and Olivier, hiformer drawing teacher, was our savior. Not easy from a distance.
Simple, priceless moments, like sharing a pizza in our favoritrestaurant in Meudon. A weekend in Tokyo, where I heard our Romaibabbling in Japanese with a laughing taxi driver. Climbing Halla satogether, the volcano on Jeju Island, or riding horses in the Mongoliasteppes. Some small miracles: a mission in France to attend ancelebrate his Strate diploma. Job hunting, eventually returning to Koreand staying there just as we left for Russia. He would have to fend fohimself again. The SAQ and then LG years, and time seemed to fly bfaster and faster. With Jérémie now in Switzerland, bringing all four ous together became a challenge. A Christmas in Moscow, then our sixtietbirthday celebration. Miraculously, I was in Seoul for his thirtietbirthday, which we could celebrate together. Covid didn't make thingeasier; thank you, Zoom. A shadow behind the webcam, we met Betty.
We met her in person at Christmas just over two years ago. We were iGeneva, and the kids were together, a rare happiness that we savorewithout moderation. Betty was adorable, always smiling, cheerful, a reajoy.
We were fortunate to have them with us again in La Rochelle last yearthis time with the opportunity to get to know Betty, to enjoy hecuriosity, her smile. A ray of sunshine in the house. She won oveuncles, brothers, and future cousins, in Paris, Bourges, ToulouseBordeaux, or in Touraine, her tour de France of families and friends. Wnever got tired of it; she is just too far away.
Thanks to Sandy and Jason for welcoming Romain into their family. Wwill have had too little time to get to know each other. I sincerelhope that the near future will give us the opportunity to reunitsomewhere on this planet.
We don't have children for ourselves, easy to say. Ultimately, iwe're honest, it's our children who made us grow up. We were neveperfect, but Dom and I are very proud of what you've become, and we arvery happy to welcome Betty into our family and see you both so weltogether, carving your path, full of projects. As Dom has already saidplease: Enjoy the journey.
And I propose a toast to wish all the possible happiness to our two lovebirds.
