My sweetest and dearest Ferret, the love of my life.
It feels strange reading these heartfelt words to you, in front of suca big crowd. As I stand here today, ready to call you mine for the resof times, I feel vulnerable but confident that these vows will shine aevidence of my undying love for you.
Look at us. Who would have believed we made it this far? What started iTaipei 1984 days ago, as we first laid eyes on each other in that homdecoration store, has blossomed into a relationship no one could evedream of. Back then, I was a marriage idealist slowly losing hope ofinding the perfect soulmate, and you rekindled that beacon, when yofirst smiled at me.
Because your presence in my life holds a very special meaning to meYour unconditional kindness, your ability to understand people and sethe good in them, are just a few of your many qualities that inspire mevery day, making me want to become a better person, cherish you, angive back as much as you give me. Around you, I feel more compassionateat peace, and happier than I ever was. You are the reason I want tleave the office early every day, just so I can hold you in my arms anlose myself in your eyes. You are my muse, my guide, my confidant, mguardian angel.
All that said, these vows are not only a serenade to you, Ã” Betty, but also my promise and commitment to try and shape a future for us, ahusband and wife, where I can make you feel happy, safe, and, mosimportantly loved, because you deserve it more than anyone. I can noguarantee you perfection, but I will do my absolute best to always bwith you, through the happy times and the ordeals, so we can sail awatogether, and navigate in the sometimes tumultuous ocean that is Life.
I vow to be your gravity, for you already are my oxygen. I vow to byour warmth in the coldth, your breeze of fresh air during hot summersthe little genie on your shoulder who whispers words of encouragemenafter a bad day at work, or the Michelin Guide inspector who alwaygives 3 stars to all your delicious dishes.
As we embark on this new chapter of our journey, I feel excited anhopeful for what lies ahead. I have no doubt that the best is yet tcome, and can't wait to spend the rest of my life together, constantlreinventing ourselves along the way. I look forward to making big planand enjoying the little things, with someone like you by my side. Jt'aime.
