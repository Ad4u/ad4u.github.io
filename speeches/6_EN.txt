"Marriage is solving together the problems you would not have if yowere alone.
I want to tell you the story of how I saw my brother grow into lovefrom when we were children to this beautiful day.
Let's start with the world of children.
We grew up always together and we had a fantastic time playing videgames, painting figurines and at the skatepark.
I remember long nights playing Magic cards, or listening to the latesepisode of comedic shows on the radio, dying of laughter at the anticof Niluge or NaheulbeuckOf course, as the oldest of the two, he also bullied me with rubbespiders.
When I had my first heartbreak, I doubted he would ever understanmatters of love. I was wrong.
Growing up into adults, I learned a few things about Romain.
I was impressed with his ability to make valuable and durablfriendships. Some of his high school friends are here today.
He made friends everywhere he went, always intriguing them with sillstories and his trusted sketch book. I remember that lonely emu, drawin the middle of the Australian bush. His view on the world sparkinterest.
So with matters of love and empathy, he certainly has been doinsomething right.
Here is what I see today, Betty and Romain are welcoming us into theilife. It's just start, it gets better from here.
The tenets of a good team, in my view, are open communication, trust anperseverance.
Romain and Betty share a common life music, they have persevered througthe hardships of distance, cultural adaptation and building a commolife in Korea (of all places!.
Betty, especially, has shown curiosity, humour, kindness and a genuinejovial willingness to engage with the world (and our family!.
With these two, I realized this was love and kinship when they showed uthey have built their own little world. We don't always understand whethey share private jokes or when they burst out laughing out of nowherebut it certainly is a pleasure to beholdPersonally, I believe this is a very good sign for your durable lovstory.
Through childhood, growing up and seeing them together today, I havlearned a lot about my brother's heart.
Betty, Romain: you are powerful adults, never lose your beautifuinner-child, keep being a team and you will solve any problem in youlife and love story.
The winds of change may rock your world, you two will raise the sailand ride them gleefully.
Thank you.
