Dear friends, family, and guests,

Today, I stand here before you to celebrate a wedding that is dear to my heart. I am honored to be able to speak on this special occasion and share a few words about the Love with a big L that unite Romain and Betty.

Allow me to take you back to a time when adventure and unexpected encounters sealed the fate of our two lovers. It was in Taiwan, a beautiful country that played a crucial role in this love story. During this trip, Romain had the chance to meet an extraordinary woman, someone who captured his heart at first sight. This special lady, as you may have already guessed, is our dear Betty.

I still remember the day I saw these two souls unite during their first date in Taiwan. It was a magical moment, a spark that ignited the fire of love in their hearts. And the next day, during their second date, I had the privilege of witnessing the beginning of their story. It was an honor to be present at this pivotal moment, to see love take shape before my eyes in a Tesla's car. Their love was so intense inside the vehicle that it seemed to electrify the atmosphere to the point where the Tesla could have started even without a battery.

On December 28, 2018, less than a month after meeting Betty, Romain bravely chose to follow his heart and pursue this new blossoming relationship. Since that day, their love has only grown, flourished, and inspired us all. They are a couple that exudes harmony and happiness, and I can only be filled with joy seeing their happiness materialize today, through their marriage.

But the story doesn't end there. After their fiery encounter in Taiwan, Romain and Betty had to face a challenging reality: they lived thousands of kilometers apart. Romain resided in Seoul, while Betty was based in Taipei.

For two long years, they maintained a long-distance relationship, bridging the gap through video calls, passionate messages, and visits as frequent as possible. But as we all know, true love is capable of overcoming the most arduous obstacles. Romain and Betty have gone through trials, sometimes heart-wrenching, but their love remained unwavering.

One of the greatest difficulties they had to face was related to visas. Betty wished to join Romain in Seoul, but the administrative formalities proved to be a real challenge. However, they never gave up on their dream of living together. Their perseverance and love guided them through these trials until they finally found a way to overcome the obstacles that stood in their way.

And today, we rejoice to see them here, united in marriage, ready to embark on a new chapter of their lives hand in hand. Their determination to overcome the difficulties of distance and administrative formalities testifies to the strength of their love and their commitment to each other.

Dear friends, let us raise our glasses to celebrate this love that has crossed continents and borders, to celebrate the determination and strength of Romain and Betty. May their marriage be a testament to their unconditional love and a promise of happy days to come.

To Romain and Betty, I send you my sincerest wishes. May your love continue to shine and inspire all those around you. May every moment of your life be filled with happiness, companionship, and eternal love.
