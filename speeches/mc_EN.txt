A couple draws its strength not only from its intimacy, but also from the people around it. And that's why we will first have a few speeches to begin with: to give strength to Betty and Romain. Although I’m here as the master of ceremony, I can’t help but have the first speech.

“Small streams make large rivers”. Indeed, our friendship took a very long time to start, and it took a while to become what it is now. Today, being the master of ceremony of your wedding is the pinnacle of this friendship. Thank you again for thinking of me for your special day.

The first time Betty saw you, she found you handsome, with a lot of charisma and a great smile. She’s right, and it’s even more true today. I’d say you aged like a good wine. And talking about wine, last time I saw you at Bordeaux and Saint-Emilion, I recall how kind and passionate man you are.

It was also the time I’ve met Betty. After few minutes of discussion, walking inside the vineyards together, I could feel her kindness and desire to share with people. You weren’t even engaged by the time, but I could feel she made you a better man, and I knew she was the perfect match for you.

You both told me that you like the dark and sarcastic sense of humor of the other. Actually, Romain told me this was one reason he fell in love. Keep this common quality to fight boredom. Boredom is one of your strongest enemies.

Finally, you both told me that you are aware that love, even if it is born of a strong feeling and mutual attraction, needs constant care, and that you must nurture it daily. There is nothing more I can say, it seems you’re already a wise couple, and I’m not afraid of your bright future. Your love will last forever.
