Thanks everyone, you came, some of you from very far away, to support Betty and Romain and witness them tying the knot.

When Romain came back from his first vacation trip to Taiwan he was delighted. So, when he announced 2 months later that he would spend the next vacation in Taiwan again, then …we knew something deep was going on.

Indeed, we started to see pictures of Betty. Then came the Covid, nevertheless Betty decided to join Romain and live in Korea, she courageously passed the first 2 week confinement in complete isolation, and then, visa expiration does it to you : you have to exit the country to get a new visa and come back for a second confinement, which she did : then I thought that these 2 were deeply committed, in such, responding to Khalil Gibran’s precept when love beckons you, follow it, even if its paths are steep and difficult.

I will not patronize on what you need to be a terrific couple, you have it all already : open mind, curiosity and respect, mutual admiration, learning to make concessions, helping each other hurdle after hurdle, sharing joyous moments, not only, as St Exupery said, looking in each other’s eyes but looking together in the same direction, I see a long path before you. Please : Enjoy the ride !

I love you.

Mom.
